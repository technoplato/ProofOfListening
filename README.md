# What the Listen out Loud Application Does

The Listen out Loud application uses a catalog of videos and compares the audio you are streaming with that catalog to detect matches in audio. It then uses those matches to verify what you're watching, and allows you to mint an NFT!

# Hackathon Info
Hey #grizzlython judges üëãüêª

I've open sourced this code with some parts where I'd hard-coded API credentials (ITS A HACKATHON SUE ME) and such removed here, but I wanted to show a history of all the commits that have been part of the last 6 weeks of work, so that is this repository. 

The most important code is in this directory: https://github.com/blueberrychopsticks/Hackathon/tree/main/CodetoSubmit, but I left the other resources I used in there as well. 

The open source code is located here: https://github.com/blueberrychopsticks/2023-grizzlython-no-sensitive/settings
